PREFACE 
THIS book is based upon the belief that the movements of prices on the exchanges are dependent to a very large degree on the mental attitude of the investing and trading public. It is the result of years of study and experience as fellow at Columbia University, news writer, statistician, on the editorial staff全体编辑人员 of THE MAGAZINE OF WALL STREET, etc. 
股票心理学
这本书基于这样的信念：股票价格的波动很大程度上来自于投资人和交易者的心理态度。这本书是多年的研究和实践成果，由哥伦比亚大学，新闻评论员，统计人员，《华尔街杂志》编辑集体编著而成。
The book is intended chiefly as a practical help to that considerable part of the community which is interested, directly or indirectly, in the markets ; but it is hoped that it may also have some scientific value as a preliminary 初步的discussion in a new field, where opportunities for further research seem almost unlimited.

# I The Speculative Cycle 
MOST experienced professional traders in the stock market will readily admit that the minor fluctuations, amounting to perhaps five or ten dollars a share in the active speculative issues, are chiefly psychological. They result from varying attitudes of the public mind, or, more strictly, from the mental attitudes of those persons who are interested in the market at the time.

大多数有经验的交易者在活跃时期的股市上都认同，5-10美元一股的波动是一个正常的范围值只是心理上的影响。
影响价格的主要来自公众的心理，更严格讲是那些关注股市的人们的心理。
Such fluctuations may be, and often are, based on "fundamental" conditions that is, on real changes in the dividend prospects of the stocks affected or on variations in the earning power of the corporations represented and again they may not. The broad movements of the market, covering periods of months or even years, are always the result of general financial conditions; but the smaller intermediate fluctuations represent changes in the state of the public mind, which may or may not coincide with alterations改动 in basic factors. 
To bring out clearly the degree to which psychology enters into the stock market problem from day to day, it is only necessary to reproduce模仿 a conversation between professional traders such as may be heard almost any day in New street or in the neighboring cafes. 
"Well, what do you know?" says one trader to the other. 
"Just covered my Steel," is the reply. 
"Too much company. Everybody seems to be short." 
"Everybody I've seen thinks just as you do. Each one has covered 支付because he thinks everybody else is short空头 still the market doesn't rally止跌回升 much. I don't believe there's much short interest left, and if that's the case we shall get another break破产." 
"Yes, that's what they all say and they've all sold short again because they think everybody else has covered. I believe there's just as much short interest now as there was before." 
价格的波动通常也许基于基本状况，比如公司的盈利能力，股息收益预期，或许不是这些。但是广义上的市场价格波动，跨越几个月甚至几年，总是这种常规财务状况的结果。只有较小的中型波动代表大众心理的变化，这种心里变化或许与基本面正好一致，或者不一致。
我们很有必要去再现一些专业人士的对话，来理清心理因素对股票市场的影响究竟到什么程度。比如大街上，咖啡馆里的对话：
你知道什么消息不？
-多买点钢铁股，
什么，大部分公司都看空呢，每个人好像都要卖掉呢。
-我知道的所有人和你想的一样都要卖掉。每个人都割肉因为每个人都认为其他人会卖掉，就算买入现在市场也不会止跌回升。我不相信还有多少下跌空间。因为如果那样的话，我们全都要破产了。
-是啊，这就是为什么他们都说要卖掉，因为他们认为其他人都在买进。我相信现在卖掉的人会跟以前形势不好的人一样多。
It is evident that this series of inversions颠倒 might be continued indefinitely无限期地. These alert警惕的 mental acrobats杂技演员 are doing a succession of flip-flops, each one of which leads up logically to the next, without ever arriving at a final stopping-place. 
The main point of their argument is that the state of mind of a man short of the market is radically different from the state of mind of one who is long. 
Their whole study, in such a conversation, is the mental attitude of those interested in the market. If a majority of the volatile 变化无常的class of in-and-out traders are long, many of them will hasten赶紧 to sell on any sign of weakness and a decline will result. If the majority are short, they will buy on any development of strength and an advance may be expected. 
The psychological aspects of speculation may be considered from two points of view, equally important. One question is, What effect do varying mental attitudes of the public have upon the course of prices? How is the character of the market influenced by psychological conditions? 
A second consideration is, How does the mental attitude of the individual trader affect his chances of success? To what extent, and how, can he overcome the obstacles placed in his pathway by his own hopes and fears, his timidities and his obstinacies固执? 
These two points of view are so closely involved and intermingled that it is almost impossible to consider either one alone. It will be necessary to take up first the subject of speculative psychology as a whole, and later to attempt to draw conclusions both as to its effects upon the market and its influence upon the fortunes of the individual trader. 
很显然这种把结果颠倒成原因的猜想不停地被放大。这种警惕的思维构成杂技演员一般连续地抛接球，每一次推论似乎都很符合逻辑。这种状态会成为墙头草得不出一个最终的结论。推论的主要依据点是一个人头脑中不可能既上涨又下跌。他们讨论的焦点在对市场感兴趣的人上。如果大多数场内和场外的交易者都认为会上涨，他们中许多人只要看到下跌或者疲软的信号就会赶紧卖掉。如果他们中大多数认为会下跌，他们会在有上涨力量介入的信号时，或者有预期上涨时积极买入。投机力量的心理作用从两方面看都是同等重要的。一个问题是，大众的心理态度变化会对价格起到什么作用？市场波动时如何被心理态度影响的，特点是什么？第二个要考虑的是，个体交易者的心理态度如何影响他的成功机率的呢？到什么程度，怎样他才能克服自己成功路上的障碍，靠他的希望和恐惧，他的胆小和固执？这两点紧密联系，互相交织，不太可能只考虑一个不考虑另一个。
首先很有必要把投机心理作为一个整体来研究，然后试着去得出两者对于市场的影响和对个体财富影响的结论。
As a convenient starting point it may be well to trace briefly the history of the typical speculative cycle, which runs its course over and over, year after year, with infinite slight variations but with substantial similarity, on every stock exchange and in every speculative market of the world and presumably大概 will continue to do so as long as prices are fixed by the competition of buyers and sellers, and as long as human beings seek a profit and fear a loss.* 
Beginning with a condition of dullness and inactivity, with small fluctuations and very slight微不足道的 public interest, prices begin to rise, at first almost imperceptibly难以察觉的. No special reason appears for the advance发展, and it is generally thought to be merely temporary, due to small professional operations. There is, of course, some short interest in "the market, mostly, at this time, of the character sometimes called a "sleeping" short interest.
/*The writer discussed this subject rather fully in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. XVI, No. 2. The article will also be found extensively summarized and quoted in Vol. VII of "Modern Business," edited by Joseph French Johnson, Dean of New York University School of Commerce. */
讨论起始，我们追踪一下典型的投机周期的历史规律，这种规律不断地重复年复一年，虽然有一点变动但是大体相似，在每一个交易市场每一个投机市场大概会一致持续这种波动只要价格是由买家和卖家定的浮动，只要人类寻求利润恐惧损失。

起始于死寂之间，一点小波动不足以引起大众兴趣，价格开始上升，先开始机会难以察觉。没有特别原因显现发展的迹象，而且通常这都是认为短暂的，是由少部分专业人士操作。这时当然对市场不感兴趣，这一阶段通常叫做“睡眠期”。（作者在其他文献中讨论这个主题）
An active speculative stock is never entirely free from shorts. As there is so little public speculation at this period in the cycle, there are but few who are willing to sell out on so small an advance, hence prices are not met by any large volume of profit-taking. The smaller professionals take the short side for a turn, with the idea that trifling fluctuations are the best that can be hoped for at the moment and must be taken advantage of if any profits are to be secured. 
/一只活跃的投机股票永远都会受到多头的关注。周期的开始很少有公众投机这种股票，有一些还会卖出少量获利，因此价格上不去。少量专业人士会等待空头的拐点，这一阶段最希望能有小幅波动以建仓保证获利。/
This class of selling brings prices back almost to their former dead level. Soon another unostentatious不夸耀的不张扬的 upward movement begins, carrying prices a trifle higher than the first. A few shrewd traders take the long side, but the public is still unmoved and the sleeping short interest most of it originally put out at much higher figures still refuses to waken. 
/这一级的卖出会导致价格比前一阵子更低的水平。但很快微小的上升趋势开始了，知道价格略微搞过第一次的高位。一些精明的交易者会站在多头建仓，不过，大众还是无动于衷，认为空头是主调和趋势，所以很快抑制住价格的进一步上升。/
Gradually prices harden further and finally advance somewhat sharply. A few of the more timid shorts cover, perhaps to save a part of their profits or to prevent their trades from running into a loss. The fact that a bull turn is coming now penetrates through another layer of intellectual density密集度 and another wave of traders take the long side. The public notes the advance and begins to think some further upturn is possible, but that there will be plenty of opportunities to buy on substantial reactions. 
渐渐地价格稳固在这个位置上，最终向前进了一大步。一些已经获利的胆小的人会抛售来保证自己的获利变现。事实上，牛市的拐点马上要刺穿低位，另一波交易者会看多。大众注意到了上升趋势开始考虑不远处可能转为空头，但即使是下跌也是一个明显的买进机会。
Strangely enough, these reactions, except of the most trifling character, do not appear. Waiting buyers do not get a satisfactory chance to take hold. Prices begin to move up faster. There is a halt from time to time, but when a real reaction finally comes the market looks "too weak无把握获胜的 to buy," and when it starts up again it often does so with a sudden leap that leaves would-be purchasers far in the rear. 
奇怪的是，股价不掉，只有轻微的振荡，等待入场的人觉得此时不是好机会。价格开始快速上升。中间会有时停一停，但是当真正的热度出现，市场显得不太可能获利的时候，价格再一次快速上升，，这让那些等着入场的人远远地丢在后视镜中。
At length the more stubborn bears become alarmed and begin to cover in large volume. The market "boils," and to the short who is watching the tape, seems likely to shoot through the ceiling at almost any moment. However firm may be his bearish convictions, his nervous system eventually gives out under this continual pounding, and he covers everything "at the market" with a sigh of relief that his losses are no greater. 
最终固执的空头们惊慌了，开始大量买进。市场迅速沸腾，而那些看着警示带显示的暴涨的空头们，准备随时准备抛售。然而坚定的看空信念，他紧张的神经最终被连续地上涨而用完，很快进场叹息自己没有更多损失。
About this time the outside public begins to reach the conclusion that the market is "too strong to react much," and that the only thing to do is to "buy them anywhere." From this source comes another wave of buying, which soon carries prices to new high levels, and purchasers congratulate themselves on their quick and easy profits. For every buyer there must be a seller or, more accurately, for every one hundred shares bought one hundred shares must be sold, as the actual number of persons buying at this stage is likely to be much greater than the number of persons selling. Early in the advance the supply of stocks is small and comes from scattered sources, but as prices rise, more and more holders become satisfied with their profits and willing to sell. The bears, also, begin to fight the advance by selling short on every quick rise. A stubborn professional bear will often be forced to cover again and again, with a small loss each time, before he finally locates the top and secures a liberal profit on the ensuing decline. 
/这时候场外的民众开始得出结论，市场过热，只要买就赚。又一波买入狂潮，价格创新高，买入者高兴自己很快赚到钱。每一个赚钱的买家都在想着什么时候卖出，价格越高，想卖出的人越多，这时，空头在每一次快速上升的时候卖出股票，少赚一点，直到锁定一个高位，一次性卖出全部，大量获利，才算平稳地迎接接下来的下跌。/
大概这个时候，场外的大众开始得出结论，市场太强烈买了就赚钱，唯一应该做的事就是随时随地买入。因此会有另一波疯狂买入，很快价格出现新高，买家庆辛自己赚了快钱。对任意一个买家，都会有一个卖家，只有当卖家的人大过卖家的人，手中的股票价格才会上涨。开始之初，股票供应很小来自零星的个别散户，但是价格升高后，越来越多的持有者因为满意收益而选择卖掉。看空者会在每一次快速上涨的时候抛售。那些坚定的看空者会在每一次上涨中不得不就会再买入，每次都会少量损失，最终锁定一个合理的价格，在价格上涨到一定高度的时候在即将到来的下跌前卖掉获利。
Those selling at this stage are not, as a rule, the largest holders. The largest holders are usually those whose judgment is sound enough, or whose connections are good enough, so that they have made a good deal of money; and neither a sound judgment nor the best advisers are likely to favor selling so early in the advance, when much larger profits can be secured by simply holding on. 
/这些卖掉的人不是大户，那些大户通常判断良好，他们会互相联系确保大赚一笔。同样，最好的顾问也不会在那么早卖掉，而是持有期待较大利润出现。/
The height to which prices can now be carried depends on the underlying conditions. If money is easy and general business prosperous a prolonged bull movement may result, while strained banking resources or depressed trade will set a definite limit to the possible advance. If conditions are bearish, the driving of the biggest shorts to cover will practically end the rise; but in a genuine bull market the advance will continue until checked by sales of stocks held for investment, which come upon the market only when prices are believed to be unduly过度高 high. 
/价格高度依赖于下面的情况。如果金钱流通，贷款容易，那么商业繁荣会延长牛市的航程。相反，银根收紧，或者经济萎缩就会提前结束一段上涨行情。如果行情下跌，空头过多会结束上涨，但在一个牛市行情则会等到股价过分高时才会结束。/
这个阶段卖掉的一般不是最大的持有者。最大的持有者通常是那些有良好判断力的，或者有足够的社会关系可以赚到大钱的主儿。不管是有良好判断力的还是最佳顾问都不会这么早卖掉股票，因为仅仅持有就可以保证大量获利。价格高危的持续依赖于下面的条件。
如果钱很容易获得，商业贷款容易，生意繁荣，这个牛市可能会延长。而如果银行收紧银根，抑制贷款将会缩短这种上涨的时间。
如果处于熊市，最大的空头（美国股票可以做空头）买入会实际上结束这种上升。但是在一个真正的牛市中，价格会持续走高直到被那些投资(不是投机)的股票买家确认后，他们认为市场价格显然虚高后就会停止上升。
In a sense, the market is always a contest between investors and speculators. The real investor, looking chiefly to interest return, but by no means unwilling to make a profit by buying low and selling high, is ready, perhaps, to buy his favorite stock at a price which will yield him six per cent, on his investment, or to sell at a price yielding only four per cent. The speculator cares nothing about interest return. He wants to buy before prices go up and to sell short before they go down. He would as soon buy at the top of a big rise at any other time, provided prices are going still higher. 
/某种程度上讲，市场是投机者与投资者之间的较量。真正的投资者，主要看投资回报率的，这不意味着说不想获取高额利润，买低买高。相对的，能有6%的回报收益，或者卖的时候能有4%的回报就可以。投机者关心的是只要在股价下跌之前卖掉即可。他会在任何一个高位买进，只要证明股价还会上涨。/
As the market advances, therefore, one investor after another sees his limit reached and his stock sold. Thus the volume of stocks to be carried or tossed from hand to hand by bullish speculators is constantly rolling up like a snowball. On the ordinary intermediate fluctuations, covering five to twenty dollars a share, these sales by investors are small compared with the speculative business. In one hundred shares of a stock selling at 150, the investor has $15,000; but with this sum the speculator can easily carry ten times that number of shares. 
/当市场上涨，达到了一部分投资者的预期值时，他就会卖掉。因此大量持有或者丢弃的股票被那些牛市投机者接手，形成滚雪球效应，越滚越大。在普通的过渡振荡期间，5-20美元一股波动对于投机者来说很小。比方说100股单价150美元，投资者有15000美元，但是投机者会买1000股单价150美元的股票，只要他认为还会上涨。/
The reason why sales by investors are so effective is not because of the actual amount of stock thrown on the market, but because this stock is a permanent load, which will not be got rid of again until prices have suffered a severe decline. What the speculator sells he or some other trader may buy back tomorrow. 
/投资者的资金像是定海神针一样，虽然实际的抛售会对市场产生一定影响，但主要还是这些资金是长期被投资者持有的，一旦价格严重下跌，很难有更多的定海神针一样的长期资金支撑市场。投机者会今天卖出明天又买回来。/
简言之，股市总是处于投资者和投机者之间的博弈。真正的投资者主要看中投资回报，当然也愿意低买高卖。他会在有6%回报收益的时候买入，也会在仅有4%的实际收益的时候卖掉。投机者只关心一件事，投资回报。他只要在价格上涨前买入就行，然后再跌之前卖掉。不管这个股票价格多高，只要有趋势上涨他也会继续买入。投资者一个接一个在市场上扬时看到利润空间不断挤压，会毫不犹豫卖掉手中股票。因此，那些大量被抛售的股票会转给那些投机者手中，这种情况持续发酵像滚雪球。
在正常的中等波动中，范围在5-20美元一股的股票中，对于投资者来说是购买的数量比投机者的小很多。在150美元一股的股票中，投资者买100股市15000美元，但是投机者的总数可以轻松达到10倍市值，150000美元。为什么投资者的购买有效力，而投机者的购买不是实际的购买呢？因为股市长期看是一个称重机，投资者购买后长期持有不会离场只有价格遇到严重下跌时才可能发生。而投机者则会在当天卖掉后，第二天就可能买回来。
The time comes when everybody seems to be buying. Prices become confused. One stock leaps upward in a way to strike 打击terror对什么的恐惧 to the heart of the last surviving short. Another appears almost equally strong, but slips下滑 back unobtrusively不招摇地 when nobody is looking, like the frog jumping out of the well in the arithmetic计算的算数的 of our boyhood. Still another churns翻腾 violently in one place, like a side-wheeler stuck on a sand-bar. 
/现在到了每个人都更像去买的时候了，价格变得让人迷惑。一只股票跃升让最后的空头恐惧也没了。另一只股票依然强健，但当没人关注的手正在悄然下跌，就像青蛙突然从井里挑出。还有一些翻腾地很剧烈，像侧轮被困在一个沙杆。/
Then the market gives a sudden lurch突然倾斜 downward, as though in danger of spilling out its unwieldy contents. This is hailed as a "healthy reaction," though it is a mystery whom it can be healthy for, unless it is the shorts. 
当市场突然向下倾斜，好像倾倒笨重的货物一样危险。这是来自正常的反应，尽管很难知道这样的回归市场价值是为谁缘故，除非这是为了空头。
Shorts cover again and again on the sharp breaks, but in most cases they put out their lines again, either higher or lower ,as opportunity offers. On the average, the short interest is largest at low prices, though there are likely to be periods during the decline when it will be larger than at the final bottom, where buying by shorts often helps to avert panicky conditions. 
空头更多在突然地下跌中进场，但大多数情况。一般说，空头利益在价格最低时最大，精怪他们可能在下跌中止损，那样的价格也远高于底部，下降中买入帮助他们防止进一步下跌。
The length of this decline, like the extent of the preceding advance, depends on fundamental conditions; for both investors and speculative capitalists will come into the market sooner if all conditions are favorable than they will in a stringent严格的 money market or when the future prospects of business are unsatisfactory. As a rule, buyers do not appear in force until a "bargain day" appears. This is when, in its downward course, the heavy load of stocks strikes an area honeycombed多孔的 with stop loss orders. Floor traders交易所场内商人 seize the opportunity to put out short lines and a general collapse results. 
下跌的时长像之前的上涨一样，依赖基本面。投资和投机资本家会更早进入市场如果情况好于紧缩货币市场或者未来预期不那么满意。买家只有到何时的价格日才出现。在下跌过程中，大量股票砸向空头。交易所场内商人扎住机会消灭空头，结果大幅下滑出现。
Here are plenty of stocks to be had cheap, and shrewd operators large and small, but mostly large or on the way to become so are busy picking them up. The fixed limits of many investors are also reached by the sharp break, and their purchases disappear, to be seen in the Street no more until the next bull turn.
大量股票廉价，精明的操作员不管大的还是小的，更多是大量的操作员去争抢这些股票。固定有限的许多投资者也停止了投资，不再出现，直到下一个牛市来临。
Many shorts cover on such a break, but not all. The sequel to the "bargain day" is a big short interest which has overstayed its market, and a quick rally follows ; but when the more urgent shorts get relief, prices sag again and fall into that condition of lethargy from which this consideration of the speculative cycle started. 
/许多空头在价格日获利，但也有一些没有解脱出来，那么因为股价已经很低，正是买入的好时候，所以那部分没有解套的人会在价格稍涨就卖掉。所以价格就没精打采的晃着，这就是另一个投机周期的开始。

价格到了每个人都想买的时候。价格已经偏离价值了。一只股票一跃而上击溃了最后的那些看空者的心理防线。另一只也几乎表现得同样强劲，不过会时不时回调一下，像井里的青蛙猛地跳出来一样猝不及防。仍然会有其他的股票会在某个价格剧烈的震荡，就像外轮汽船的一侧扎在沙滩上一样咆哮。
然后市场突然向下倾斜，尽管处于下跌倾销的危险，但是会被认为是一种健康的反应。虽然不知道这种健康是对谁来说，除了那些空头大概没有人喜欢。空头在快速的下跌预期中大量进场，但大多数时候他们又打消这个念头。通常空头的利益在价格最低时最大，在最终底部尽管在没跌到谷底过程中会有一些停滞阶段，空头多少会防止市场过度焦虑的情绪。这个下跌的时间和之前上涨的程度很像都依赖于基本的财务状况。
投机者和投资者在市场资金充裕未来预期乐观的时候，都倾向于更早入场。一般的规则是不到拐点出现买家不进场。这时大批止损单交易导致大幅下挫。场内交易员抓住机会加剧空头股市崩盘。到处可见的大量便宜股票会被大大小小的精明的交易者收入囊中。这次崩盘也导致有限的投资者深受损失，他们直到下次牛市开启才可能见到。许多空头下跌中买进,也不是全部都买。转折点之后的很长一段时间都有利于大空头，然后回快速止跌回升。当更多的空头着急获利后，市场又会下跌变成死寂一样的状态。从而开始下一阶段投机周期。
The movements described are substantially uniform, whether the cycle be one covering a week, a month, or a year. The big cycle includes many intermediate movements, and these movements in turn contain smaller swings. Investors do not participate to any extent in the small swings, but otherwise the forces involved in a three-point turn up and down are substantially the same as those which appear in a thirty-point cycle, though not so easy to identify. 
/上面描述的三种变化可以来解释一周一月一年的波动。大周期是由无数个中等周期，小周期组成的。投资者没有参与任何一个小的波动，3个点和30个点的循环实际上是一样的，知识没那么容易看出来。/
The fact will at once be recognized that the above description is, in essence, a story of human hopes and fears ; of a mental attitude, on the part of those interested, resulting from their own position in the market, rather than from any deliberate judgment of conditions ; of an unwarranted projection by the public imagination of a perceived present into an unknown though not wholly unknowable future. 
事实上我们能从上面的描述中看到波动的本质是希望与恐惧并存的博弈。他们的心态在市场上得到体现，而不是直接对现状的判断。因此对于未来也不是不可知的。
上述的运动过程基本是一致的，不管是一周，一月还是一年。大周期中有中间的波动，每个波动又有一系列的波动。投资者是不会参与这种小波动的，即使是一个3点的波动也和30点的波动时一样的，虽然不那么容易觉察。
上述波动描述其实就是关于人类的希望和恐惧的故事。出于买家的股票位置判断而不是因为市场的基本情况。出于大众的想象认知出的现状的对一个未知却不是完全不能预测的未来投射。
/我们的任务是找出投机者的心理的成因。/
Laying aside for the present the influence of fundamental conditions on prices, it is our task to trace out both the causes and the effects of these psychological elements in speculation. 
不考虑基本面对价格的影响，我们主要任务是找出投机心理是由哪些因素影响的，有什么样的结果。
# II Inverted Reasoning and its Consequences 
/第二章颠倒的理由和结果
对于普通人来说，特立独行反对主流观点很难做到。在股市中，尤其如此。因为我们知道股价很大程度是在长期看是依赖公众的看法的。最容易混淆的是，股市中公众的观点是以美元来衡量而不是人数。一个有100万的人要比1000个有1000块的人更有影响力。美元是驱动股市上扬下跌的动力而不是人数。这就是为什么大人物的观点是价高的时候是牛市，价低的时候是熊市。大量小散户一定在价格高的时候看多，在价格低的时候看空或者出场。很简单的事实是党他们在高位看多的时候他们的股票一定是从其他人那里买来的。又因为有100万的大户默不作声。只有他完成对自己的有利的交易之后才会出声。相反，那些1000个散户不停地讨论猜测，其中有证券报社的评论员，记者这些掌握大众媒体话语权的人，政府发言人还有专门制造谣言的小出版社。就是对这一点观察我们得出一个结论那些消息评论大部分都是错的，很可能是相反的，至少有一些涉及到投机波动的部分是真实的。这不是恭维大众观点模式，而是大多数有经验的新闻读者都会同意短期因投机而波动的报道是对的。
出版社展示的是大多数民众的想法，在股市上了解大众的想法很必要，这是作为逻辑推断，以事实出发赚取利润的必要手段，就像搞价格时就是牛市，低价格时就是熊市。普通人的一般心理是对自己选的公司股票或者自己的公司很有信心，对别人的比较悲观。这种心理股市同样适用于专业交易者。出于上述理由，他习惯性地预期他人都错了，相信自己的分析和判断将会正确。他珍视少数成功的交易者，除此之外，越多的人看多牛市，他就越怀疑市场会走向牛市。/
IT is hard for the average man to oppose what appears to be the general drift of public opinion. In the stock market this is perhaps harder than elsewhere ; for we all realize that the prices of stocks must, in the long run, be controlled by public opinion. The point we fail to remember is that public opinion in a speculative market is measured in dollars, not in population. One man controlling one million dollars has double the weight of five hundred men with one thousand dollars each. Dollars are the horse-power of the markets the mere number of men does not signify. 
长期看，股票以及所有投机市场都是人的心理因素决定的，但是股票市场是以美元为驱动力的。当一个有100万筹码的人的心理与总共100万的1000个人心理冲突时，那个有100万人的心理更有影响力。
This is why the great body of opinion appears to be bullish at the top and bearish at the bottom. The multitude of small traders must be, as a plain necessity, long when prices are at the top, and short or out of the market at the bottom. The very fact that they are long at the top shows that they have been supplied with stocks from some source. 
这也是为什么那些主要人物的意见在牛市顶部和熊市底部.
Again, the man with one million dollars is a silent individual. The time when it was necessary for him to talk is past his money now does the talking. But the one thousand men who have one thousand dollars each are conversational, fluent, verbose to the last degree; and among these smaller traders are the writers the newspaper and news bureau men, and the manufacturers of gossip for brokerage houses. 
有100万的那个人是一个沉默的个体，他会用钱行动而不是讨论各种可能。像评论员，政府人员，造谣者，证券代理商。
It will be observed that the above course of reasoning leads us to the conclusion that most of those who write and talk about the market are more likely to be wrong than right, at least so far as speculative fluctuations are concerned. This is not complimentary to the "molders of public opinion/' but most seasoned newspaper readers will agree that it is true. The press reflects, in a general way, the thoughts of the multitude, and in the stock market the multitude is necessarily, as a logical deduction from the facts of the case, likely to be bullish at high prices and bearish at low. 
认真观察的话，那些媒体和政府的小人物们往往误导我们从而失去对市场的正确认识。至少投机波动非常关心这些消息。这不是对公众意见的补充但是大多数经验丰富的保值读者都会以为这些消息是真的。出版社反应的一般来说是大众的想法，在股市上大众的想法有必要了解，作为逻辑推理来判断价格高点和低点。
It has often been remarked that the average man is an optimist regarding his own enterprises and a pessimist regarding those of others. Certainly this is true of the professional trader in stocks. As a result of the reasoning outlined above, he comes habitually to expect that nearly every one else will be wrong, but is, as a rule, confident that his own analysis of the situation will prove correct. He values the opinions of a few persons whom he believes to be generally successful ; but aside from these few, the greater the number of the bullish opinions he hears, the more doubtful he becomes about the wisdom of following the bull side. 
普通人对自己投的股票信心度高，而对其他的悲观。这是股市专业交易者的现状，结果基于以上原因，他习惯于期望其他人都错，自己预测的就是对的。他信赖那些他敬仰的人的观点，但是出去这少数的几个成功人士，大部分人的牛市观点让他怀疑牛市的观点了。
This apparent contrariness of the market, although easily understood when its causes are analyzed, breeds in professional traders a peculiar sort of skepticism leads them always to distrust the obvious and to apply a kind of inverted reasoning to almost all stock market problems. Often, in the minds of traders who are not naturally logical, this inverted reasoning assumes the most erratic and grotesque 奇异的forms, and it accounts for many apparently absurd fluctuations in prices which are commonly charged to manipulation. 
/这种明显反方向与市场趋势的行为是由于一些怀疑者不信任这种情况，对于那些逻辑性步枪，这种原因归咎于操控。/
For example, a trader starts with this assumption : The market has had a good advance ; all the small traders are bullish; somebody must have sold them the stock which they are carrying; hence the big capitalists are probably sold out or short and ready for a reaction or perhaps for a bear market. Then if a strong item of bullish news comes out one, let us say, that really makes an important change in the situation he says, "Ah, so this is what they have been bulling the market on ! It has been discounted by the previous rise." Or he may say, "They are putting out this bull news to sell stocks on." He proceeds to sell out any long stocks he may have or perhaps to sell short. 
例如，一个交易者开始这样设想，市场上涨行情中，所有小交易都是牛市，一些人一定随着抛售套现。所以那些大户一定开始卖出或者准备看市场反应而动。一旦有利多消息出现，大户就开始怀疑这是有人故意放消息，所以他开始撤退，那些原本长期持有的也开始卖出。
His reasoning may be correct or it may not; but at any rate his selling and that of others who reason in a similar way, is likely to produce at least a temporary decline on the announcement of the good news. This decline looks absurd to the outsider and he falls back on the old explanation, "All manipulation." 
他的理由也许是对的，也许是错的。但是他和其他基于同样理由卖的人会造成市场短暂的下跌。这就是好消息带来的短暂下跌影响。局外人以为这就是他们一直以为的操控。
The same principle is often carried further. You will find professional traders reasoning that favorable figures on the steel industry, for example, have been concocted编造 to enable insiders to sell their Steel ; or that gloomy reports are put in circulation to facilitate accumulation. Hence they may act in direct opposition to the news and carry the market with them, for the time at least. 
这条原则适用于更远。专业的交易人推理钢铁产业的股价时会编造出理由让内部人买出股票，或者暗淡的业绩报告来吓走持有者，从中积累囤货。因此，他们遇到消息时会反向操作。
The less the trader knows about the fundamentals. of the financial situation the more likely he is to be led astray in conclusions of this character. If he has confidence in the general strength of conditions he may be ready to accept as genuine and natural, a piece of news which he would otherwise receive with cynical skepticism and use as a basis for short sales. If he knows that fundamental conditions are unsound, he will not be so 'likely to interpret bad news as issued to assist in accumulation of stocks. 
交易者越少知道这个基本原理，他就越有可能迷失自己。如果他知道基本面不好，他不会因此解读那些坏消息是持有加仓的信号。
The same reasoning is applied to large purchases through brokers known to be associated with capitalists. In fact, in this case we often hear a double inversion, as it were. Such buying may impress the observer in three ways : 
1. The "rank outsider" takes it at face value, as bullish. 
2. A more experienced trader may  say, "If they really wished to get the stocks they would not buy through their own brokers, but would endeavor to conceal their buying by scattering it among other houses." 
3. A still more suspicious professional may turn another mental somersault and say, 'They are buying through their own brokers so as to  throw us off the scent and make us think someone else is using their brokers as a blinzss2d6565 ." By this double somersault such a trader arrives at the same conclusion as the outsider. 
这种明显反市场的意识种子很容易搅乱显而易见的判断，专业人士会怀疑不信任这种市场局面。这就叫由果导因，因为大家都看好牛市，所以我认为不太会使牛市。
对于那些逻辑关系不清晰的人来说这种由果导因的明显错误的思考模式导致了很多荒谬的价格波动，通常他们认为有人操控了价格。
例如，一个散户假设：市场已经上涨了很高了。所有的散户都牛市，一定有人准备卖掉股票，因此大资本很可能卖出或者准备空仓观察准备迎接下一个熊市。如果一记重磅牛市消息出来，比如说。这会改变当下的情形，“这是大户准备拉升股价，上一次涨幅已经减弱了。”或者他说，“大户借着这消息准备出货呢”。他准备卖掉手中原本长期持有的或者准备卖空的股票。他的理由也许对，也许不对。不管他什么时候卖掉总有和他想法一样的人以相似的理由卖掉。这样很可能会导致股市因为利好出现短暂的下跌。这种下跌很匪夷所思，场外人士回到以前的老观念，“全都是操纵”。这个套路还可以用到更远的方面。你会发现专业交易者解释说钢铁业的大人物联合场内人卖掉股票，或者他们散布负面消息，趁机吸收筹码。
/同样的原理会适用于经纪人交易大宗资金。实际上，这种方式我们经常听到两种相反的声音。大宗交易给观察者留下印象
1外面人以为是牛市
2有经验的交易者会认为他们买股票不会从自己的经纪人而是想隐藏他们购买的意图
3持怀疑态度的专业交易人会180度大转弯，说：“他们通过自己的经纪人购买以此来蛊惑我们让我们相信有人悄悄用匿名账户买入”。这样的两次怀疑最后的得出的结论和场外人一样，牛市！/
The reasoning of traders becomes even more complicated when large buying or selling is done openly by a big professional who is known to trade in and out for small profits. If he buys 50,000 shares, other traders are quite willing to sell to him and their opinion of the market is little influenced, simply because they know he may sell 50,000 the next day or even the next hour. For this reason great capitalists sometimes buy or sell through such big professional traders in order to execute their orders easily and without arousing suspicion. Hence the play of subtle intellects around big trading of this kind often becomes very elaborate. 
对于那些靠赚小差价获利的专业大户情形变得复杂了。如果他买5万股，有人卖他5万股，市场基本不会受到影响，因为他们知道大户会明天或者几个小时后就卖掉。因为这个原因，资本大亨买卖通过这些人来执行就不会引起怀疑。因此这些头脑聪明的人玩起大交易来都是精心策划雕琢的。
It is to be noticed that this inverted reasoning is useful chiefly at the top or bottom of a movement, when distribution or accumulation is taking place on a large scale. A market which repeatedly refuses to respond to good news after a considerable advance is likely to be "full of stocks." Likewise a market which will not go down on bad news is usually "bare of stocks." Between the extremes will be found long stretches in which capitalists have very little cause to conceal their position. Having accumulated their lines as low as possible, they are then willing to be known as the leaders of the upward movement and have every reason to be perfectly open in their buying. 
因此他们会反其道行之至少那时是这样想的。交易者越少关注基本面他越容易被他这种观点落在后面。如果他对所持股票公司的财务状况有信心他会乐意看到上涨时真实的价值体现，否则他就会怀疑并作为卖空的依据。如果他知道基本面不好他不会把坏消息解释为收集筹码的理由。这也适用于与大资本家有关的股票经纪人。实际上，我们经常看到两种相反的版本像过去一样。这种购买会给观察者留下影响：
1场外的人认为这就是牛市。
2更有经验的交易者会猜想，大户一定会不遗余力地隐藏自己的购买，去其他帐户和经纪人那里买入大量股票。
3有些更加怀疑的交易者会认为大户从自己的经纪人那里买股票却声称这是其他人委托他买的，这样得出的结论和场外一样都是牛市到来了。
许多散户会非常迷惑当大户的买卖有那些历来交易频繁的大户操作。这些人会很快买入5万股，然后在明天甚至下一小时卖掉，然后再某个时间买入。因此市场不会受到影响，因为这个原因很多大型资本喜欢找到这样的大户来操作这样不会引起怀疑。这种出货或者买入方式隐秘精细难以察觉。
/值得注意的是这种反转原因常用于一个运动的高点和低点，当分散和聚集大规模发生时。市场在相当大的上涨后重复拒绝回应好消息很可能是牛市。否则遇到坏消息不下跌常是熊市。这两者极端之间资本很难藏匿。在地位集聚尽可能多，他们会成为每次上涨运动的领导者，也因此有极大动机公开买入。/ 
This condition continues until they are ready to sell. Likewise, having sold as much as they desire, they have no reason to conceal their position further. even though a subsequent decline may run for months or a year. 
这种情况持续到他们卖掉。同样的，他们不再隐瞒自己卖出多少，因为已经卖掉想卖的了。即使接下来的下跌持续几个月或者一年。
It is during a long upward movement that the "lamb" makes money, because he accepts facts as facts, while the professional trader is often found fighting the advance and losing heavily because of his over-development of cynicism and suspicion. 
在较长的上升期“羔羊”赚钱因为他们认为接受事实就是事实，而专业人员总是不相信会上涨，因而错失良机损失惨重。
The successful trader eventually learns when to invert his natural mental processes and when to leave them in their usual position. Often he develops a sort of instinct which could scarcely be reduced to cold print. But in the hands of the tyro新手 this form of reasoning is exceedingly dangerous, because it permits of putting an alternate construction on any event. Bull news either (1) is significant of a rising trend of prices, or (2) indicates that "they" are trying to make a market to sell on. Bad news may indicate either a genuinely bearish situation or a desire to accumulate stocks at low prices. 
成功的交易者最终学会什么时候抑制自己的猜疑，什么时候相信自己的猜疑。他们培养出一种直觉很少失误。但是新手这样做就很危险，因为牛市消息要么刺激股价上涨，要么显示他们准备做空。坏消息同样如此，要么表示处于熊市，要么是建仓的好时机。
The inexperienced operator is therefore left very much at sea. He is playing with the professional's edged tools and is likely to cut himself. Of what use is it for him to try to apply his reason to stock market conditions when every event may be doubly interpreted? 
很容易注意到这种颠倒因果的思考主要对于顶部和底部操作有很大用处，比如大规模发生的分销和集聚。股价上涨一段行情后，利好消息出来却市场重复拒绝上扬很可能是“不差股票”。相反市场遇到坏消息却不下跌，说明已经“缺少股票”。在这两个极端之间这么大的伸展区间资本家很难有理由隐藏他们的位置。或者在底部已经吸收足够的筹码，他们很乐意成为向上行情的领跑者所以高调自己的购买。即使接下来的下跌会很长久。
只有在大趋势面前小散户才能呢个赚点钱，因为他看到事实就是接受这样的事实。而那些专业交易者往往怀疑这种虚假的上涨从而导致严重的错过赚钱机会。
成功的交易者最终学会了何时用脑去处理，何时用趋势去判断。通常他们培养出了一种直觉很少失误。对于新手，这种做事依据 是异常危险的，因为对于每一种情况都有两种建设性的选择。利好消息要么是股价上涨的趋势信号，要么预示着大户机构准备出货。坏消息也会真的是熊市或者是想在底部吸收筹码。
/没经验的操作者因此茫然不知所措。他在玩锋利的刀却不自知，操作不好就会割自己的手。对于他来说两种市场解释无法判断，那么这个专业交易者的工具有什么用呢？/
Indeed, it is doubtful if the professional's distrust of the obvious is of much benefit to him in the long run. Most of us have met those deplorable糟糕的 mental wrecks毁坏, often found among the "chairwarmers" in brokers' offices, whose thinking machinery seems to have become permanently demoralized泄气 as a result of continued acrobatics杂技. They are always seeking an "ulterior motive" in everything. They credit or debit Morgan and Rockefeller with the smallest and meanest trickery and ascribe to them the most artful duplicity欺骗 in matters which those "high financiers金融家" wouldn't stoop屈身 to notice. The continual reversal of the mental engine sometimes deranges精神错乱 its mechanism. 
没经验的操作者因此不知所措。他在用专业的工具因此很可能伤到自己。那么对于不确定股市状况每个事件都可以两面去解读，这个工具对于新手来说又有何用？实际上，专业选手对明显的事实怀疑对于长期投资来讲并不是好事。我们大多数人都会犯以上的认知缺陷，这种错误经常在经纪人办公室中出现，他们永远处于一种泄气的状态因为心理上不停的反复无常。他们总是在找什么“其他动机”。他们归责于或者以为自己是借着向摩根和洛克菲勒
Probably no better general rule can be laid down than the brief one, "Stick to common sense/' Maintain a balanced, receptive mind and avoid abstruse deductions. A few further suggestions may, however, be offered : If you already have a position, in the market, do not attempt to bolster up your failing faith by resorting to intellectual subtleties in the interpretation of obvious facts. If you are long or short of the market, you are not an unprejudiced judge, and you will be greatly tempted to put such an interpretation upon current events as will coincide with your preconceived opinion. It is hardly too much to say that this is the greatest obstacle to success. The least you can do is to avoid inverted reasoning in support of your own position.

/因此对于专业交易者来说，长期看不信任明显的事实是否有益于交易还是未知。大多数人都有这种头脑上的谬误，经常在经纪人办公室中出现，他们总认为有各种阴谋论所以玩着杂技一样提心吊胆的生活。要么是怀疑摩根和洛克菲勒的操纵，归结于他们这样的金融家的欺骗（实际上他们这些金融家是不屑一顾的）。这种持续的怀疑导致头脑机器出现失误和错乱。/

Probably no better general rule can be laid down than the brief one, "Stick to common sense/' Maintain a balanced, receptive mind and avoid abstruse深奥的 deductions推断. A few further suggestions may, however, be offered : 
/没有更好的建议如“坚持常识”那样能准确判断了。拥有一个开放心态，不去想深奥的推断。一些更进一步的建议可以是：/
If you already have a position, in the market, do not attempt to bolster强化 up your failing faith by resorting诉诸于 to intellectual subtleties细微 in the interpretation of obvious facts. If you are long or short of the market, you are not an unprejudiced无偏见的 judge, and you will be greatly tempted to put such an interpretation upon current events as will coincide相符 with your preconceived 预先形成的opinion. It is hardly too much to say that this is the greatest obstacle to success. The least you can do is to avoid inverted颠倒 reasoning in support of your own position. 
如果你在市场上处于一个位置，不要强化你错误的信念通过诉诸明显的事实。预先形成的观点会影响你现在的判断，这样就很难说是否能成功。越少避免这种由果导因的逻辑，越能接近事实。

（以上：实际上专业选手不相信明显的事实从长期看对他来说不是好事。我们大多数人都会有这种糟糕的心理上的反复无常。那些经纪人办公室里常见的这种矛盾心理使人非常泄气。他们总是在找一种“阴谋论”不管什么事情都持有这种论调。他们相信或者归责与摩根或者洛克菲勒用诡计逃过那些“财务高级人员”从而注意不到他们的伎俩。持续的这种心理矛盾反转思维有时扰乱了大脑机器思考的正常性。恐怕没有更好的原则如此简洁的：“坚持常识判断”。保持平衡和开放的心态避免过于深奥的推论。（比如说简单的看彩报表就可以把90%不可合格的公司过滤）耿静一步的建议也许是，你要有一个市场中的位置，但这个位置不能让你觉得要固执己见，在明显事实面前微妙地解读强化你的最初的判断是不对的。你要不偏不倚，虽然这很难，会受到很多诱惑把当下的事情解读成你预先想的那样。不难知道这才是通往成功最大的阻碍。你至少可以避免为了支持你的观点而颠倒因果。）

After a prolonged延长的 advance, do not call inverted reasoning to your aid帮助 in order to prove that prices are going still higher; likewise after a big break do not let your bearish deductions become too complicated. Be suspicious of bull news at high prices, and of bear news at low prices. 
过了较长一段时间的上涨后，不要把颠倒的因果观音作为证明你股价继续上涨的理由。就像，大跌之后不要认为股票会快速反弹。对高价格的牛市消息要小心，对低价的熊市消息要怀疑。
Bear in mind that an item of news usually causes but one considerable相当大的 movement of prices. If the movement takes place before the news comes out, as a result of rumors and expectations, then it is not likely to be repeated after the announcement is made; but if the movement of prices has not preceded, then the news contributes to the general strength or weakness of the situation and a movement of prices may follow. 
记住一则新闻通常只会造成一次较大的价格波动。如果波动在新闻出来前，作为谣言和预期的结果，那么宣布消息后不大可能重复波动。如果之前没有股价波动，那么消息会推波助澜形成强化或者弱化市场行情的效果。
# III "They" 

IF a man entirely unfamiliar with the stock market should spend several days around the Exchange listening to the conversation of all sorts of traders and investors, in order to pick up information about the causes of price movements, the probability is that the most pressing急切的 question in his mind at the end of that time would be "Who are They?'" 
一个完全不懂股市的门外汉急切需要去交易市场听交易者和投资者的对话信息，来搞清楚价格波动的缘由有哪些。其中对话的一个问题总能提到一个“他们”。
Everywhere he went he would hear about Them. In the customers' rooms of the fractional lot houses he would find young men trading in ten shares and arguing learnedly as to what They were to do next. Tape readers experts and tyros alike would tell him that They were accumulating Steel, or distributing Reading. Floor traders场内交易员 and members of the Exchange would whisper that they were told They were going to put the market up, or down, as the case might be. Even sedate平静的 investors might inform him that, although the situation was bearish, undoubtedly They would have to put the market temporarily暂时 higher in order to unload Their stocks. 
不管在哪都能听说他们。在客户交易室一些极小的单比如10股，他们热烈讨论自己所知道的，以及下一步怎么做。录下准教授或者专家和新手的对话，可以知道他们正在急剧钢铁股，或者清仓中。场内交易员和交易所的成员小声嘀咕说他们已经得知内幕消息市场上扬或者下跌，事实可能如此。甚至平静的走自认也会告知他虽然情况是熊市，但是他们会暂时拉升方便出货。
This "They" theory of the market is quite as prevalent among successful traders as among beginners probably more so. There may be room for argument as to why this is so, but as to the fact itself there is no doubt. Whether They are a myth or a definite reality, many persons are making money by studying the market from this point of view. 
这种“他们”理论在成功人士和初学者之间非常流行。也许这种做法值得考虑，但是事实本身不用怀疑。不管他们是谜题，还是现实的一种定义，许多人通过研究这个角度赚到了很多钱。
If you were to go around Wall street and ask various classes of traders who They are, you would get nearly as many different answers as the number of people interviewed. One would say, "The house of Morgan"; another, "Standard Oil and associated interests" which is pretty broad, when you stop to think of it ; another, "The big banking interests" ; still another, "Professional traders on the floor"; a fifth, "Pools in the various favorite stocks, which act more or less in concert" ; a sixth might say, "Shrewd and successful speculators, whoever and wherever they are" ; while to the seventh, They may typify merely active traders as a whole, whom he conceives to make prices by falling over each other to buy or to sell. 
如果你去华尔街走一走，问问不同级别的交易人这个“他们”是谁，你会得到千奇百怪的答案。一个会说，摩根大通，第二个说，标准石油和相关的逻辑集团，这样说很宽泛，当你停下来想一想的时候。第三个说，大银行利益，第四个说，场内专业交易人，第五个说，像音乐会一样的一个组合投资人，第六个说，精明成功的投机者，第七个说，所有活跃交易者能够使市场波动买卖的交易综合。
Indeed, one writer of no small attainments成就 as a student of market conditions believes that the entire phenomena of the New York stock market are under the control of some one individual, who is presumably大概, in some way or other, the representative of great associated interests. 
事实上，没有成就的市场小人物作家相信市场的整个波动是由一些个利益财团控制的。
It seems obviously impossible to trace to its source, tag标记 and identify any sort of permanent controlling power. The stock markets of the world move pretty much together in the broad cyclical swings, so that such a power would have to consist of a world-wide association of great financial interests, controlling all of the principal security markets. The average observer will find it difficult to masticate咀嚼and swallow this proposition主张. 
很显然，不可能追踪到那些永远能控制走向的力量。世界所有的股票市场都是一个大的周期波动，这种能联合世界级资本控制主要证券市场的力量基本不存在。普通人可以发现这种假设漏洞百出。
The effort to reduce the science of speculation and investment to an impossible definiteness定义 or an ideal simplicity is, I believe, responsible for many failures. A. S. Hardy, the diplomat, who was formerly a professor of mathematics and wrote books on quaternions, differential calculus, etc., once remarked that the study of mathematics is very poor mental discipline, because it does not cultivate the judgment. Given fixed and certain premises, your mathematician will follow them out to a correct conclusion; but in practical affairs the whole difficulty lies in selecting your premises. 
通过数学模型简化、解决投机和投资这门科学我认为是无意义的，注定失败的。已经有人这么干了。问题的关键在于无数的假设，虽然每一种假设都可以得出一个相对科学的答案，但是你无法判断到底那个假设是正确的。
So the market student of a mathematical数学的 turn of mind is always seeking a rule or a set of rules a "sure thing" as traders put it. He would not seek such rules for succeeding in the grocery 食品杂货店生意business or the lumber木材 business; he would, on the contrary, analyze each situation as it arose and act accordingly. The stock market presents itself to my mind as a purely practical proposition主张. Scientific methods may be applied to any line of business, from stocks to chickens, but this is a very different thing from trying to reduce the fluctuations of the stock market to a basis of mathematical certainty. 
市场中用数学思想寻找一个规则和简化的公式的做法行不通，这一点交易者也要注意。他同样无法在饰品店或者木头生意中用这种思维成功。相反的，他要分析趋势，当上涨的时候有根据地行动。科学手段可以应用于任何线性生意，从股票到禽肉类市场，但是很难减少股市波动，很难像数学一样那么确定。
In discussing the identity of Them, therefore, we must be content to take obvious facts as we find them without attempting to spin编造 fine theories. There are three senses in which this idea of 'Them" has some foundation in fact. First, "They" may be and often are roughly conceived of as the floor traders on the Stock Exchange who are directly concerned in making quotations报价, pools formed to control certain stocks, or individual manipulators. Floor traders exercise an important influence on the immediate movement of prices. Suppose, for example, they observe that offerings of Reading are very light. Declines do not induce liquidation and only small offerings of stock are met on advances. They begin to feel that, in the absence of unexpected cataclysms大灾难, Reading will not decline much. The natural thing for them to do is to begin buying Reading on all soft spots. Whenever a few hundred shares are offered at a bargain, floor traders snap up the stock. As a result of this "bailing out" of the market, Reading becomes scarcer still, and traders, being now long, become more bullish. They begin to "mark up prices." This is not difficult, since they are, for the time being, practically unanimous一致意见 in a desire for higher prices. Suppose the market is 161 J^j bid, offered at 161%. They find that only 100 shares are for sale at J4, and 200 are offered at 3/g. As to how much stock may be awaiting bids at Z or higher, they cannot be sure, but can generally make a shrewd guess. One or more traders take these offerings, of perhaps 500 shares, and make the market 3/2 bid. The other floor traders are not willing to sell at this trifling profit, and a wait ensues to see whether any outside orders are at traded by the movement of the price, and if so, whether they are buying or selling orders. If a few buying orders come in, they are rilled, perhaps at ^ and 24- If selling appears, the floor traders retire in good order, take the offerings at lower prices, and try it again the next day or perhaps the next hour. Eventually, by seizing every favorable opportunity, they engineer an upward move of perhaps two or three points without taking any more stock than they want. 
在讨论如何定义他们因此我们一定要尊重事实，而不是试着编造一些好理论。
If such a movement attracts a following, it may easily run ten points without any real change in the prospects of the Reading road though the prospects of the road may have had something to do with making the stock scarce before the movement started. On the other hand, if large offerings of stock are encountered at the advance, the boomlet is ignominiously squelched and the floor traders make trifling profits or losses. Pools are not so common as most outsiders believe. There are many difficulties and complications to be overcome before a pool can be formed, held together, and operated successfully, as we had ample opportunity to observe not long ago in the case of Hocking Coal & Iron. 
But if a definite pool exists in any stock, its operations are practically a reproduction, on a larger scale and under a binding agreement, of the methods employed by floor traders over a smaller range and in a mere loose and voluntary association resulting from their common interests. And the individual manipulator is only a pool consisting of one person. 

Second, many conceive "Them" as an association of powerful capitalists who are running a campaign in all the important speculative stocks simultaneously. It is safe to say that no such permanent and united association exists, though it would be hard to prove such a statement. But there have been many times when a single great interest was practically in control of the market for a time, other interests being content to look on, or to participate in a small way, or to await a favorable chance to take the other side. 

The "Standard Oil crowd," the "Gates crowd/' the "Morgan interests/' and Harriman and his associates, will at once occur to the reader as having been, at various times in the past, in sole control of an important general campaign. At present the great interests are generally classified into three divisions Morgan, Standard Oil, and Kuhn-Loeb. 
A definite agreement among such interests as these would be impossible, except for limited and temporary purposes. This is perhaps not so much because these high financiers couldn't trust each other, as it is because each so-called interest consists of a loosely bound aggregation of followers of all sorts and varieties, having only one thing in common control of capital. Such an "interest" is not an army, where the traitor can be court-martialed and shot; it is a mob, and has to be led, not driven. 
True, the known traitor might be put to death, financially speaking, but in stock market operations the traitor cannot, as a rule, be known. Unless his operations are of unusual size, he can successfully cover his tracks. From this second point of view, "They" are not always active in the market. Great campaigns can only be undertaken with safety in periods when the future is to a certain extent assured. When the future is in doubt, when various confusing elements enter into the financial and political situation, leading financiers may be quite content to confine their stock market operations to individual deals, and to postpone the inauguration of a broad campaign until a more solid foundation exists for it. 

Third, "They" may be conceived simply as speculators and investors in general all that miscellaneous and heterogeneous troop of persons, scattered over the whole world, each of whom contributes his mite to the fluctuations of prices on the Stock Exchange. In this sense there is no doubt about the existence of Them, and They are the court of last resort in the establishment of prices. To put it another way, these are the "They" who are the ultimate consumers of securities. It is to Them that everybody else is planning, sooner or later, directly or indirectly, to sell his stocks. 

You can lead the horse to water, but you can't make him drink. You or I or any other great millionaire can put up prices, but you can't make Them buy the stocks from you, unless They have the purchasing power and the purchasing disposition. So there is no doubt that here, at any rate, we have a conception of Them which will stand analysis without exploding. 
In cases where a general campaign is being conducted, the "They" theory of values is of considerable help in the accumulation or distribution of stocks. In fact, in the late stages of a bull campaign the argument most frequently heard is likely to be something as follows: "Yes, prices are high and I can't see that future prospects are especially bullish but stocks are in strong hands and They will have to put them higher to make a market to sell on." Some investors - make a point of dumping over all their stocks as soon as this veteran war-horse of the news brigade is groomed and trotted out. Likewise, after a prolonged bear campaign, we hear that somebody is "in trouble" and that They are going to break the market until certain concentrated holdings are brought out. 
All this is very likely to be nothing but dust thrown in the eyes of that most gullible of all created beings the haphazard speculator. When prices are so high in comparison with conditions that no sound reason can be advanced why they should go higher, a certain number of people are still induced to buy be- cause of what They are going to do. Or, at least, if the public can no longer be induced to buy in any large volume, it is prevented from selling short for fear of what They may do. 

The close student of the technical condition of the market by which is meant the character of the long and short interests from day to day is pretty sure to base his operations to a considerable extent on what he thinks They will do next. He has in mind Them as described in the first classification above floor traders, pools and manipulators. He gets a good deal of help from this conception, crude as it may appear to be largely, no doubt, because it serves to distract his mind from current news and gossip, and to prevent him from being too greatly influenced by the momentary appearance of the market. 

When the market looks weakest, when the news is at the worst, when bearish prognostications are most general, is the time to buy, as every schoolboy knows; but if a man has in mind a picture of a flood of stocks pouring out from the four quarters of the globe, with no buyers, because of some desperately bad news which is just coming over the ticker, it is almost a mental impossibility for him to get up the courage to plunge in and buy. If, on the other hand, he conceives that They are just giving the market a final smash to facilitate covering a gigantic line of short stocks, he has courage to buy. His view may be right or wrong, but at least he avoids buying at the top and selling at the bottom, and he has nerve to buy a weak market and sell a strong one. 

The reason for the haziness of the "They" conception in the average trader's mind is that he is only concerned with Them as They manifest Themselves through the stock market. As to who They are he feels a mild and detached curiosity ; but as to Their manifestations 
in the market he is vitally and financially interested. It is on the latter point, therefore, that he concentrates his thoughts. 
But inasmuch as definite, painstaking analysis of a situation is always better than a hazy general notion of it, the trader or investor would do much better to rid his mind of Them. The word "They" means nothing until it has an antecedent; and to use it continually without having any antecedent in mind is slipshod language, which stands for slipshod thinking. They, in the sense of the big banking interests, may be working directly against Them in the sense of individual manipulators; the manipulator, again, may be trying to trap Them in the sense of floor traders. 

A genuine knowledge of the technical condition of the market cannot be summed up in any offhand declaration about what They are going to do. You cannot determine the attitude toward the market of every individual who is interested in it, but you can roughly classify the sources from which buying and selling are likely to come, the motives which are likely to actuate the various classes, and the character of the long interest and short interest. In brief, after enough study and observation, you can always have in mind some kind of an antecedent for Them, and must have it, if you base your operations on technical conditions 

# IV Confusing the Present with the Future Discounting 

IT is axiomatic that inexperienced traders and investors, and indeed a majority of the more experienced as well, are continually trying to speculate on past events. Suppose, for example, railroad earnings as published are showing constant large increases in net. The novice reasons, "Increased earnings mean increased amounts applicable to the payment of dividends. Prices should rise. I will buy." Not at all. He should say, "Prices have risen to the extent represented by these increased earnings, unless this effect has been counterbalanced by other considerations. Now what next?" 
It is a sort of automatic assumption of the human mind that present conditions will continue, and our whole scheme of life is necessarily based to a great degree on this assumption. When the price of wheat is high farmers increase their acreage because wheat-growing pays better; when it is low they plant less. I remember talking with a potato-raiser who claimed that he had made a good deal of money by simply reversing the above custom. When potatoes were low he had planted liberally; when high he had cut down his acreage because he reasoned that other farmers would do just the opposite. 
The average man is not blessed or cursed, however you may look at it with an analytical mind. We see "as through a glass darkly." Our ideas are always enveloped in a haze and our reasoning powers work in a rut from which we find it painful if not impossible to escape. Many of our emotions and some of our acts are merely automatic responses to external stimuli. Wonderful as is the development of the human brain, it originated as an enlarged ganglion, and its first response is still practically that of the ganglion. 
A simple illustration of this is found in the enmity we all feel toward the alarm clock which arouses us in the morning. We have carefully set and wound that alarm and if it failed to go off it would perhaps put us to serious inconvenience ; yet we reward the faithful clock with anathemas. 

When a subway train is delayed nine-tenths of the people waiting on the platforms are anxiously craning their necks to see if it is coming, while many persons on it who are in danger of missing an engagement are holding themselves tense, apparently in the effort to help the train along. As a rule we apply more well-meant, but to a great extent ineffective, energy, physical or nervous, to the accomplishment of an object, than analysis or calculation. 

When it comes to so complicated a matter as the price of stocks, our haziness increases in proportion to the difficulty of the subject and our ignorance of it. From reading, observation and conversation we imbibe a miscellaneous assortment of ideas from which we conclude that the situation is bullish or bearish. The very form of the expression "the situation is bullish" not "the situation will soon become bullish" shows the extent to which we allow the present to obscure the future in the formation of our judgment. 
Catch any trader and pin him down to it and he will readily admit that the logical moment for the highest prices is when the news is most bullish; yet you will find him buying stocks on this news after it comes out if not at the moment, at any rate "on a reaction." 
Most coming events cast their shadows before, and it is on this that intelligent speculation must be based. The movement of prices in anticipation of such an event is called "discounting," and this process of discounting is worthy a little careful examination. 
The first point to be borne in mind is that some events cannot be discounted, even by the supposed omniscience of the great banking interests which is in point of fact, more than half imaginary. The San Francisco earthquake is the standard example of an event which could not be foreseen and therefore could not be discounted; but an event does not have to be purely an "act of God" to be undiscountable. There can be no question that our great bankers have been as much in the dark in regard to some recent Supreme Court decisions as the smallest "piker" in the customers' room of an odd-lot brokerage house. 

If the effect of an event does not make itself felt before the event takes place, it must come after. In all discussion of discounting we must bear this fact in mind in order that our subject may not run away with us. 
On the other hand an event may sometimes be overdiscounted. If the dividend rate on a stock is to be raised from four to five per cent., earnest bulls, with an eye to their own commitments, may spread rumors of six or seven per cent., so that the actual declaration of five percent, may be received as disappointing and cause a decline. 
Generally speaking, every event which is under the control of capitalists associated with the property, or any financial condition which is subject to the management of combined banking interests, is likely to be pretty thoroughly discounted before it occurs. There is never any lack of capital to take advantage of a sure thing, even though it may be known in advance to only a few persons. 
The extent to which future business conditions are known to "insiders" is, however, usually overestimated. So much depends, especially in America, upon the size of the crops, the temper of the people, and the policies adopted by leading politicians, that the future of business becomes a very complicated problem. No power can drive the American people. Any control over their action has to be exercised by cajolery or by devious and circuitous methods. 

Moreover, public opinion is becoming more volatile and changeable year by year, owing to the quicker spread of information and the rapid multiplication of the reading public. One can easily imagine that some of our older financiers must be saying to themselves, "If I had only had my present capital in 1870, or else had the conditions of 1870 to work on today!" 
A fair idea of when the discounting process will be completed may usually be formed by studying conditions from every angle. The great question is, when will the buying or selling become most general and urgent? In 1907, for example, the safest and best time to buy the sound dividend-paying stocks was on the Monday following the bank statement which showed the greatest decrease in reserves. The markets opened down several points under pressure of liquidation, and standard issues never sold so low afterward. The simple explanation was that conditions had become so bad that they could not get any worse without utter ruin, which all parties must and did unite to prevent. 
Likewise in the Presidential campaign of 1900, the lowest prices were made on Bryan's nomination. Everyone said at once, "He can't be elected." Therefore his nomination was the worst that could happen the point of time where the political news became most intensely bearish. As the campaign developed his defeat became more and more certain, and prices continued to rise in accordance with the general economic and financial conditions of the period. 

It is not the discounting of an event thus known in advance to capitalists, that presents the greatest difficulties, but cases where considerable uncertainty exists, so that even the clearest mind and the most accurate information can result only in a balancing of probabilities, with the scale perhaps inclined to a greater or less degree in one direction or the other. 

In some cases the uncertainty which precedes such an event is more depressing than the worst that can happen afterward. An example is a Supreme Court decision upon a previously undetermined public policy which has kept business men so much in the dark that they feared to go ahead with any important plans. This was the case at the time of the Northern Securities decision in 1904. "Big business" could easily enough adjust itself to either result. It was the uncertainty that was bearish. Hence the decision was practically discounted in advance, no matter what it might prove to be. 

This was not true to the same extent of the Standard Oil and American Tobacco decisions of 1911, because those decisions were an earnest of more trouble to come. The decisions were greeted by a temporary spurt of activity, based on the theory that the removal of uncertainty was the important thing ; but a sensational decline started soon after and was not checked until the announcement that the Government would prosecute the United States Steel Corporation. This was deemed the worst that could happen for some time to come, and was followed by a considerable advance. 

More commonly, when an event is uncertain the market estimates the chances with considerable nicety. Each trader backs his own opinion, strongly if he feels confident, moderately if he still has a few doubts which he cannot down. The result of these opposing views may be stationary prices, or a market fluctuating nervously within a narrow range, or a movement in either direction, greater or smaller in proportion to the more or less emphatic preponderance of the buying or selling. 

Of course it must always be remembered that it is the dollars that count, not the number of buyers or sellers. A few great capitalists having advance information which they regard as accurate, may more than counterbalance thousands of small traders who hold an opposite opinion. In fact, this is a condition very frequently seen, as explained in a previous chapter. Even the operations of an individual investor usually have an effect on prices pretty accurately adjusted to his opinions. When he believes prices are low and everything favors an upward movement, he will strain his resources in order to accumulate as heavy a load of securities as he can carry. After a fair advance, if he sees the development of some factor which might cause a decline though he doesn't really believe it will he thinks it wise to lighten his load somewhat and make sure of some of his accumulated profits. Later when he feels that prices are "high enough," he is a liberal seller; and if some danger appears while the level of quoted values continues high, he "cleans house/' to be ready for whatever may come. Then if what he considers an unwarranted speculation carries prices still higher, he is very likely to sell a few hundred shares short by way of occupying his capital and his mind. 

It is, however, the variation of opinion among different men that has the largest influence in making the market responsive to changing conditions. A development which causes one trader to lighten his line of stocks may be regarded as harmless or even beneficial by another, so that he maintains his position or perhaps buys more. Out of a world-wide mixture of varying ideas, personalities and information emerges the average level of prices the true index number of investment conditions. 
The necessary result of the above line of reasoning is that not only probabilities but even rather remote possibilities are reflected in the market. Hardly any event can happen of sufficient importance to attract general attention which some process of reasoning cannot construe as bullish and some other process interpret as bearish. Doubtless even our old friend of the news columns to the effect that "the necessary activities of a nation of ninety million souls create and maintain a large volume of business/' may influence some red-blooded optimist to buy 100 Union ; but the grouchy pessimist who has eaten too many doughnuts for breakfast will accept the statement as an evidence of the scarcity of real bull news and will likely enough sell 100 Union short on the strength of it. 
It is the overextended speculator who causes most of the fluctuations that look absurd to the sober observer. It does not take much to make a man buy when he is short of stocks "up to his neck." A bit of news which he would regard as insignificant at any other time will then assume an exaggerated importance in his eyes. His fears increase in geometrical proportion to the size of his line of stocks. Likewise the overloaded bull may begin to "throw his stocks" on some absurd story of a war between Honduras and Ron mania, without even stopping to look up the geographical location of the countries involved. 
Fluctuations based on absurdities are always relatively small. They are due to an exaggerated fear of what "the other fellow" may do. Personally, you do not fear a war between Honduras and Ron mania ; but may not the rumor be seized upon by the bears as an excuse for a raid? And you have too many stocks to be comfortable if such a break should occur. Moreover, even if the bears do not raid the market, will there not be a considerable number of persons who, like yourself, will fear such a raid, and will therefore lighten their load of stocks, thus causing some decline? The professional trader, following this line of reasoning to the limit, eventually comes to base all his operations for short turns in the market not on the facts but on what he believes the facts will cause others to do or more accurately, perhaps, on what he sees that the news is causing others to do; for such a trader is likely to keep his finger constantly on the pulse of buying and selling as it throbs on the floor of the Exchange or as recorded on the tape. 
The non-professional, however, will do well not to let his mind stray too far into the unknown territory of what others may do. Like the "They" theory of values, it is dangerous ground in that it leads toward the abdication of common sense ; and after all, others may not prove to be such fools as we think they are. While the market is likely to discount even a possibility, the chances are very much against our being able to discount the possibility profitably. 
In this matter of discounting, as in connection with most other stock market phenomena, the most useful hint that can be given is to avoid all efforts to reduce the movement of prices to rules, measures, or similarities and to analyze each case by itself. Historical parallels are likely to be misleading. Every situation is new, though usually composed of familiar elements. Each element must be weighed  by itself and the probable result of the combination estimated. In most cases the problem is by no means impossible, but the student must learn to look into the future and to consider the present only as a guide to the future. Extreme prices will come at the time when the news is most emphatic and most widely disseminated. When that point is passed the question must always be, "What next?" 

# V Confusing the Personal with the General 
IN a previous chapter the fact has been mentioned that one of the greatest difficulties encountered by the active trader is that of keeping his mind in a balanced and unprejudiced condition when he is heavily committed to either the long or short side of the market. Unconsciously to himself, he permits his judgment to be swayed by his hopes. 
A former large speculator on the Chicago Board of Trade, after being short of the market and very bearish on wheat for a long time, one day surprised all his friends by covering everything, going long a moderate amount, and arguing violently on the bull side. For two days he maintained this position, but the market failed to go up. He then turned back to the short side, and had even more bear arguments at his tongue's end than before. 
To a certain extent he did this to test the market, but still more to test himself to see whether, by changing front and taking the other side, he could persuade himself out of his bearish opinions. When even this failed to make any real change in his views, he was reassured and was ready for a new and more aggressive campaign on the short side. 
There is nothing peculiar about this condition. While it is especially difficult to maintain a balanced mind in regard to commitments in the markets, it is not easy to do so about anything that closely touches our personal interests. As a rule we can find plenty of reasons for doing what we very much want to do, and we are still more prolific with excuses for not doing what we don't want to do. Most of us change the old sophism "Whatever is, is right" to the more directly useful form "Whatever I want is right." 
To many readers will occur at once the name of a man prominent in public life who seems very frequently to act on this motto. If Smith and Jones have a verbal agreement, which afterwards turns out to be greatly to Jones' advantage, Smith's recollection is that it was merely a loose understanding which could be cancelled at any time, while Jones remembers it to have been a definite legal contract, perfectly enforceable if it had only been written. Talleyrand said that language was given us for the purpose of concealing thought. Likewise many seem to think that logic was given us for the purpose of backing up our desires. 
Few persons are so introspective as to be able to tell where this bias in favor of their own interests begins and where it leaves off. Still fewer bother to make the effort to tell. To a great extent we train our judgment to lend itself to our selfish interests. The question with us is not so much whether we have the facts of a situation correctly in mind, as whether we can "put it over." 
When it comes to buying and selling stocks, there is no such thing as "putting it over." The market is relentless. It cannot be budged by our sophistries. It will respond exactly to the forces and personalities which are working upon it, with no more regard for our opinions than if we couldn't vote. We cannot work for our own interests as in other lines of business we can only fit our interests to the facts. 
To make the greatest success it is necessary for the trader to forget entirely his own position in the market, his profits or losses, the relation of present prices to the point where he bought or sold, and to fix his thoughts upon the position of the market. If the market is going down the trader must sell, no matter whether he has a profit or a loss, whether he bought a year ago or two minutes ago. 
How far the average trader is from attaining this point of view is quickly seen from his conversation, and it is also true that a great deal of the literature of speculation absolutely fails to reach this conception. 
"You have five points profit you had better take it," advises the broker. Perhaps so, if you know nothing about the market ; but if you understand the market the time to take your profit is when the upward movement shows signs of culminating, regardless of your own deal. 
"Stop your losses ; let your profits run" is a saying which appeals to the novice as the essence of wisdom. But the whole question is where to stop the losses and how far to let the profits run. In other words, what is the market going to do? If you can tell this your personal losses and profits will take care of themselves^, Here is a man who has done a great deal of figuring and has proved to his own satisfaction that seven points is the correct profit to take in Union Pacific, while losses should be limited to two and one-half points. Nothing could be more foolish than these arbitrary figures. He is trying to make the market fit itself around his own trades, instead of adapting his trades to the market. 
In any broker's office you will notice that a large part of the talk concerns the profits and losses of the traders. Brown had a profit of ten points and then let it get away from him. "Great Scott!" says his wise friend. "What do you want? Aren't you satisfied with ten points profit?" The reply should be, though it rarely is, "Certainly not, if I think the market is going higher." 
"Get them out with a small profit," I once heard one broker say to another. "If you don't they will hang on and take a loss. They never get profit enough to satisfy them." A good policy, probably, if neither the broker nor his customer had any real knowledge of the market; but mere nonsense for the trader who aims to be in the slightest degree scientific. 
The fact 'is that the more a trader allows his mind to dwell upon his own position in the market the more likely it is that his judgment will become warped so that his mind is blind to those considerations which do not fall in with his preconceived opinion. 
Until you try it, you have almost no idea of the extent to which you may be rendered unreasonable by the mere fact that you are committed to one side of the market. "In the market, to be consistent is to be stubborn/' some one has said; and it is true that the man of strong will and logical intellect is often less successful than the more shallow and volatile observer, who is ready to whiffle about like the weathercock at any suspicion of a change in the wind. This is because the strong man has in this instance embarked upon an enterprise where he cannot use his natural force and determination he can employ only his faculties of observation and interpretation. Yet in the end the man of character will be the more permanently successful, because he will eventually master his subject more thoroughly and attain a more judicial attitude. 
The more simple-minded, after once committing themselves to a position, are thereafter chiefly influenced and supported by the illusions of hope. They bought, probably, as a result of some bullish development. If prices have advanced, they find that the market "looks strong," a good deal of encouraging news comes out on the tickers, and they hope for large profits. After five points in their favor, they hope for ten, and after ten they look for fifteen or twenty. 
On the other hand, if prices decline they charge it to "manipulation," "bear raids," etc., and expect an early recovery. Much of the bear news appears to them to be put out maliciously, in order to cause prices to decline further. It is not until the decline begins to cause a painful encroachment upon their capital that they reach the point of saying, "If 'they' can depress prices like this in the face of a bullish situation, what is the use of fighting them? By a flood of short sales, they can put prices down as much as they like" or something of the sort. 
Such traders are suffering merely from youth, or lack of sound business sense, or both. They have a considerable period of study before them, if they persist until they get permanently profitable results. Most of them, of course, do not persist. 
A much more intelligent class, many of whom are properly to be considered as investors, do not allow their position in the market to blind them so far as current news or statistical developments are concerned, but do permit themselves to become biased in regard to the most important factor of all the effect of a change in the price level. 
They bought stocks in the expectation of an improved situation. The improved situation comes and prices rise. Nothing serious in the way of bear news appears. On the contrary, bull news continues plentiful. 
Under these conditions they see no reason for selling. Yet there may be a most important reason for selling namely, that prices have risen sufficiently to counterbalance the improved situation and they would see and appreciate this fact if they were in the position of an uninterested observer. 
One of the principal reasons why investors of this class allow themselves to become confused as to the influence of the price level is because a bull market nearly always goes unreasonably high before it culminates. The investor has perhaps, in several previous instances, sold out at what he thought was a fair price level, only to see the public run away with the market to a point where his profits would have been doubled if he had held on. 
It is in such cases that an expert knowledge of speculation is essential. If the investor has not this knowledge, and cannot obtain the dependable advice of one who has it, then he must content himself with more moderate profits and' forego the expectation of getting the full benefit of the advance. 
But with a fair knowledge of speculative influences, he can fix his mind on the development of the campaign, regardless of his own holdings, and can usually secure a larger profit than if he depended merely upon ordinary business "common sense." 

The mistake is made when, without any expert knowledge of speculation, he permits himself to hold on in the hope of higher prices after a level has been reached which has fairly discounted improved business conditions. 
Not one trader in a thousand ever becomes so expert or so seasoned as to entirely overcome the influence his position in the market exerts upon his judgment. That influence appears in the most insidious and elusive ways. One of the principal difficulties of the expert is in preventing his active imagination from causing him to see what he is looking for just because he is looking for it. 
An example will make this clear. The expert has learned from experience, let us say, that the appearance of "holes" in the market is a sign of weakness. By a "hole" is meant a condition of the market where it suddenly and unaccountably refuses to take stock. A few hundred shares of an active stock are offered for sale. Sentiment is generally bullish, but there is no buyer for that stock. Prices slip quickly down half a point or a point before buyers are found. This, in an active stock, is unusual; and although the price may recover, the professional does not forget this treacherous failure of the market to accept moderate offerings. He considers it a sign of an "over-bought" market. 
Now suppose the trader has calculated that an advance is about to culminate and has taken the short side in anticipation of that event. He suspects that the market is over-bought, but is not yet sure of it. Under these circumstances any little dip in the price will perhaps look to him like a "hole," even though under other conditions he would not notice it or would think nothing about it. He is looking for the development of weakness and there is danger that his imagination may show him what he is looking for even though it isn't there ! 
The same remarks would apply to the detection of accumulation or distribution. If you want to see distribution after a sharp advance, you are very likely to see it. If you have sold out and want to get a reaction on which to repurchase, you will see plenty of indications of a reaction. Indeed, it is a sort of proverb in Wall Street that there is no bear so bearish as a sold- out bull who wants a chance to repurchase. 
In the study of so-called "technical" conditions of the market, a situation often appears which permits a double construction. Indications of various kinds are almost evenly balanced ; some things might be interpreted in two different ways; and a trader not already interested in the market would be likely to think it wise to stay out until he could see his way more clearly. 
Under such circumstances you will find it an almost invariable rule that the man who was long before this condition arose will interpret technical conditions as bullish, while the man who was and remains short, sees plain indications of technical weakness. Somewhat amusing, but true. In this matter of allowing the judgment to be influenced by personal commitments, very little of a constructive or practically helpful nature can be written, except the one word "Don't." Yet when the investor or trader has come to realize that he is a prejudiced observer, he has made progress ; for this knowledge keeps him from trusting too blindly to something which, at the moment, he calls' judgment, but which may turn out to be simply an unusually strong impulse of greed. 
It has often been noted by stock market writers that since the great public is bearish at the bottom and bullish at the top, it could make its fortune and beat the multi-millionaires at their own game by simply reversing itself buying when it feels like selling and selling when it feels like buying. Tom Lawson, in the heyday of his publicity, seems to have had some sort of dream of the public selling back to Standard Oil capitalists the stocks which it had bought from them and thus bringing everything to smash in a heap the philanthropic Thomas, doubtless, being first properly short of the market. 
This wrongheadedness of the public no longer exists to the same extent as formerly. A great number of small investors buy and sell intelligently and there has been a most noticeable falling off in the gambling class of trade much to the satisfaction of everyone, except, perhaps, the brokers who formerly handled such business. 
It remains true, nevertheless, that the very moment when the market looks strongest, is likely to be near the top, and just when prices appear to have started on a straight drop to the zero point is usually near the bottom The practical way for the investor to use this principle is to be ready to sell at the moment when bull sentiment seems to be most widely distributed, and to buy when the public in general seem most discouraged. It is especially important for him to bear this principle in mind in taking profits on previous commitments, as his own interests are then identified with the current trend of prices. 
In a word, the trader or investor who has studied the subject enough to be reading this book, probably could not make profits by reversing himself, even if such a thing were possible; but he can endeavor to hold himself in a detached, unprejudiced frame of mind, and to study the psychology of the crowd, especially as it manifests itself in the movement of prices. 
# VI The Panic and the Boom 
BOTH the panic and the boom are eminently psychological phenomena. This is not saying that fundamental conditions do not at times warrant sharp declines in prices and at other times equally sharp advances. But the panic, properly so-called, represents a decline greater than is warranted by conditions, usually because of an excited state of the public mind, accompanied by exhaustion of resources; while the term "boom" is used to mean an excessive and largely speculative advance. 
There are some special features connected with the panic and the boom which are worthy of separate consideration. It is really astonishing what a hold the fear of a possible panic has upon the minds of many investors. The memory of the events of 1907 has undoubtedly operated greatly to lessen the volume of speculative trade from that time to the present (April, 1912). 
Panics of equal severity have occurred only a few times in the entire history of the country, and the possibility of such an outbreak in any one month is smaller than the chance of loss on the average investment through the failure of the company. Yet the specter of such a panic rises in the minds of the inexperienced whenever they think of buying stocks. 
"Yes," the investor may say, "Reading seems to be in a very strong position, but look where it sold in 1907 at $70 a share !" 
It is sometimes assumed that the low prices in a panic are due to a sudden spasm痉挛 of fear, which comes quickly and passes away quickly. This is not the case. In a way, the operation of the element of fear begins when prices are near the top. Some cautious investors begin to fear that the boom暴涨 is being overdone and that a disastrous decline must follow the excessive speculation for the rise. They sell under the influence of this feeling. 
During the ensuing decline, which may run for years, more and more people begin to feel uneasy over business or financial conditions, and they liquidate清算 their holdings. This caution or fearfulness gradually spreads, increasing and decreasing in waves, but growing a little greater at each successive连续的 swell上涨. The panic is not a sudden development, but is the result of causes long accumulated. 
The actual bottom prices of the panic are more likely to result from necessity必须的 than from fear. Those investors who could be frightened out of their holdings are likely to give up before the bottom is reached. The lowest prices are usually made by sales for those whose immediate resources are exhausted. Most of them are taken by surprise and could raise the money necessary to carry their stocks if they had a little time; but in the stock market, "time is the essence of the contract," and is the very thing that they cannot have. 
The great cause of loss in times of panic is the failure of the investor to keep enough of his capital in liquid form. He becomes "tied up" in various undertakings so that he cannot realize quickly. He may have abundant property, but no ready money. This condition, in turn, results from trying to do too much greed, haste, excessive ambition, an oversupply of easy confidence as to the future. 
It is noticeable in panic times that a period arrives when nearly every one thinks that stocks are low enough, yet prices continue downward to a still lower level. The result is that many investors, after thinking that they have "loaded up" near the bottom, find that it was a false bottom, and are finally forced to throw over their holdings on a further decline. 
This is due to the fact mentioned above, that final low prices are the result of necessities, not of opinions. In 1907, for example, every one of good sense knew perfectly well that stocks were selling below their value the trouble was that investors could not get hold of the money with which to buy. 
The moral is that low prices, after a prolonged bear period, are not in themselves a sufficient reason for buying stocks. The key to the situation lies in the accumulation of liquid capital, which is most quickly evidenced by a rapid recovery of the excess of deposits over loans in the New York clearing house banks (excluding the trust companies, in which loans are more varied). This subject, however, takes us outside our present field. 
It is to a great extent because the last part of the decline in a panic has been caused not by public opinion, or even by public fear, but by necessity, arising from absolute exhaustion of available funds, that the first part of the ensuing recovery takes place without any apparent reason. Traders say, "The panic is over, but stocks cannot go up much under such bearish conditions as now exist." Yet stocks can and do go up, because they are merely regaining the natural level from which they were depressed by "bankrupt sales," as we would say in discussing dry goods. 
Perhaps the word "fear" has been overworked in the discussion of stock market psychology. It is only the very few who actually sell their stocks under the direct influence of the emotion of fear. But a feeling of caution strong enough to induce sales, or even a fixed belief that prices must decline, constitutes in itself a sort of modification of fear, and has the same result so far as prices are concerned. 
The effect of this fear or caution in a panic is not limited to the selling of stocks, but is even more important in preventing purchases. It takes far less uneasiness to cause the intending investor to delay purchases than to precipitate actual sales by holders. For this reason, a small quantity of stock pressed for sale in a panicky惊恐的 market may cause a decline out of all proportion to its importance. The offerings may be small, but nobody wants them. 
It is this factor which accounts for the rapid recoveries which frequently follow panics. Waiting investors are afraid to step in front of a demoralized泄气的 market, but once the turn appears, they fall over each other to buy. The boom is in many ways the reverse of the panic. Just as fear keeps growing and spreading until the final crash, so confidence and enthusiasm keep reproducing each other on a wider and wider scale until the result is a sort of hilarity狂欢 on the part of thousands of men, many of them comparatively young and inexperienced, who have "made big money" during the long advance in prices. 
These imaginary millionaires appear in a small swarm涌动的人群 during every prolonged bull market, only to fall with their wings singed as soon as prices decline. Such speculators are, to all practical intents and purposes, irresponsible. It is their very irresponsibility不负责任的 which has enabled them to make money so rapidly on advancing prices. The prudent谨慎地 man gets only moderate profits in a bull market it is the man who trades on "shoe-string margins" who gets the biggest benefit out of the rise. When such, mushroom fortunes have accumulated, the market may fall temporarily into the hands of these dare-devil spirits, so that almost any recklessness鲁莽 is possible for the time. It is this kind of buying which causes prices to go higher after they are already high enough just as they go lower in a panic after they are plainly seen to be low enough. 
When prices get above the natural level, a well-judged short interest begins to appear. These shorts are right, but right too soon. In a genuine bull market they are nearly always driven to cover by a further rise, which is, from any common sense standpoint, unreasonable. A riot骚乱 of pyramided margins drives the sane and calculating short seller temporarily to shelter. 
A psychological influence of a much wider scope also operates to help a bull market along to unreasonable heights. Such a market is usually accompanied by rising prices in all lines of business and these rising prices always create, in the minds of business men, the impression that their various enterprises are more profitable than is really the case. 
One reason for this false impression is found in stocks of goods on hand. Take the wholesale grocer, for example, carrying a stock of goods which inventories $10,000 in January, 1909. On that date Bradstreet's index of commodity prices stood at 8.26. In January, 1910, Bradstreet's index was 9.23. If the prices of the various articles included in this stock of groceries increased in the same ratio as Bradstreet's list, and if the grocer had on hand exactly the same things, he would inventory them at about $11,168 in January, 1910. 
He made an additional profit of $1,168 during the year without any effort, and probably without any calculation, on his part. But this profit was only apparent, not real; for he could not buy any more with the $11,168 in January, 1910, than he could have bought with the $10,000 in January, 1909. He is deceived into supposing himself richer than he really is, and this false idea leads to a gradual growth of extravagance挥霍 and speculation in every line of business and every walk of life. 

The secondary results of this delusion of increased wealth because of rising prices, are even more important than the primary results. Our grocer, for example, decides to spend this $1,168 for an automobile. This helps the automobile business. Hundreds of similar orders induce the automobile company to enlarge its plant. This means extensive purchases of material and employment of labor. The increased demand resulting from a similar condition of things in all departments of industry produces, if other conditions are favorable, a still further rise in prices; hence at the end of another year the grocer perhaps has another imaginary profit, which he spends in enlarging his residence or buying new furniture, etc. 
The stock market feels the reflection of all this increased business and higher prices. Yet the whole thing is psychological, and sooner or later our grocer must earn and save, by hard work, economical living and shrewd calculation, the amount he has paid for his automobile or furniture. 
Again, rising stock prices and rising commodity prices react on each other. If the grocer, in addition to his imaginary profit of $1,168 sees a ten per cent, advance in the prices of various securities which he holds for investment, he is encouraged to still larger expenditures; and likewise if the capitalist notes a ten per cent, advance in the stock market, he perhaps employs additional servants and enlarges his household expenditures so that he buys more groceries. Thus the feeling of confidence and enthusiasm spreads wider and wider like ripples from a stone dropped into a pond. And all of these developments are faithfully reflected by the stock market barometer气压表. The result is that, in a year like 1902 or 1906, the high prices for stocks and the feverish activity of general trade are based, to an entirely unsuspected extent, on a sort of pyramid of mistaken impressions, most of which may be traced, directly or indirectly, to the fact that we measure everything in money and always think of this money-measure as fixed and unchangeable, while in reality our money fluctuates in value just like iron, potatoes, or "Fruit of the Loom织布机." We are accustomed to figuring the money-value of wheat, but we get a headache when we try to reckon the wheat-value of money. 
When a fictitious虚假的 situation like this begins to go to pieces, the stock market, fulfilling its function of barometer, declines first, while general business continues active. Then the "money sharks of Wall Street" get themselves roundly cursed by the public and there is a widespread desire to wipe them off the earth in summary fashion. The stock market never finds itself popular unless it is going up; yet its going down undoubtedly does far more to promote the country's welfare in the long run, for it serves to temper the crash which must eventually come in general business circles and to forewarn us of trouble ahead so that we may prepare for it. 
It is generally more difficult to distinguish the end of a stock market boom than to decide when a panic is definitely over. The principle of the thing is simple enough, however. It was an oversupply of liquid capital that started the market upward after the panic was over. Similarly it is exhaustion of liquid capital which brings the bull movement to an end. This exhaustion is shown by higher call money rates, loss of the excess of deposits over loans in New York clearinghouse banks, a steady rise in commercial paper rates, and a sagging凹陷的 market for high-grade bonds. 
# VII The Psychology of Scale Orders 

THE observer of market conditions soon comes to know that there are two general classes of minds whose operations are reflected in prices. These classes might be named the "impulsive冲动的" and the "phlegmatic冷静的." The "impulsive" operator says, for example, "Conditions, both fundamental and technical, warrant higher prices. Stocks are a purchase." Having formed this conclusion, he proceeds to buy. He does not try or expect to buy at the bottom. On the contrary he is perfectly willing to buy at the top so far, provided he sees prospects of a further advance. When he concludes that conditions have turned bearish, or that the advance in prices has overdiscounted previous conditions, he sells out. 
The "phlegmatic" type of investor, on the other hand, can hardly ever be persuaded to buy on an advance. He reasons, "Prices frequently move several points against conditions, or at least against what the conditions seem to me to be. The sensible thing for me to do is to take advantage of these contrary movements." 
Hence when he believes stocks should be bought he places an order to buy on a scale. His thought is : "It seems to me stocks should advance from these prices, but I am not a soothsayer占卜者, and prices have often declined three points when I felt just as bullish as I do now. So I will place orders to buy every half point down for three points. These speculators are a crazy lot and there is no knowing what passing breeze might strike them that would cause a temporary decline of a few points." 
Among large capitalists, and especially in the banking community, the "phlegmatic" type naturally predominates占大多数. Such men have neither the time nor the disposition to watch the ticker closely and they nearly always disclaim否认 any ability to predict the smaller movements of prices. They are entirely ready, nevertheless尽管如此, to take advantage of these small fluctuations when they occur, and having plenty of capital, they can easily accomplish this by buying or selling on a scale. 
As a matter of fact, the market is usually full of scale orders, and the knowledge of this and of the way in which such orders are handled is decidedly helpful in judging the tone and technical position of the market from day to day. The two types of operators above described are always working against each other. The buying or selling of the "impulsive" trader tends to force prices up or down, while the scale orders of the "phlegmatic" class tend to oppose any movement. 
For example, let us suppose that banking interests believe conditions to be fundamentally sound and that the general trend of the market will be upward for some time to come. Orders are therefore placed by various persons to buy stocks every point down, or every half, quarter, or even eighth point down. 
On the other hand, the active floor traders find that, owing to some temporary unfavorable development, a following can be obtained on the bear side. They perceive the presence of scale orders, but they think stocks enough will come out on the decline to fill the scale orders and leave a balance over. 
To put it another way, the floating supply of stocks has become, at the moment, larger than can comfortably be tossed扔 about from hand to hand by the in-and-out class of traders. The market must decline until a part of this floating supply is absorbed by the scale orders which underlie current prices. 
These conditions produce what is commonly called a "reaction." Once this surplus floating supply of stocks is absorbed by standing orders, the market is ready to start upward again. If the general trend is upward, far less resistance will be encountered on the advance than was met on the reaction ; hence prices rise to a new high level. Then profit-taking sales will be met, on limited or scale orders at various prices, and as the market advances the floating supply will gradually increase until it again becomes unwieldy复杂的 and another reaction is necessary. 
Eventually a level is reached, or some change in conditions appears, which causes these scale buying orders to be partially or entirely withdrawn, and selling orders to be substituted on a scale up. The bull market will not go much further after this change takes place. It has now become easier to produce declines than advances. The situation is the reverse of that described above, and a bear market follows. 
Commonly* there is a considerable period around top prices when scale buying orders are still found on declines, but profit-taking sales are also met on advances, so that the market is kept fluctuating within comparatively narrow limits for a month or more. In fact, it is likely to be kept on this level so long as public buying continues greater than public selling. This is sometimes called "distribution." A similar period of "accumulation" often occurs after a bear market has run its course, and before any important advance appears. 
A close watch of transactions, or a study of continuous quotations as published in certain newspapers, often enables the experienced trader to discover when the most important of these scale orders are withdrawn or reversed反转. A bull market which is full of scale buying orders encounters "support' so-called, on declines. Bears are timid about driving down prices, because they are continually "losing their stocks." They say that "very little stock comes out on declines"; hence there is a certain appearance of caution in the way the market goes down, and the activity of trade shows, in a broad way, a falling off at lower prices. On the advances, however, a following is obtained and activity increases. 
Toward the end of the bull market a change is noticeable. Prices go down easily and on larger transactions, while advances are sluggish缓慢的 and opposition is met at higher levels where profit-taking orders have been placed. The very day when scale buying orders in a stock are withdrawn can often times be distinguished. In a bear market, "pressure" appears in place of "support." The scale orders are mostly to sell as the market rises. Only a small following of purchasers is obtainable on advances, hence the activity of business, in a general way, falls off as prices go up. The end of the bear market is marked by the reappearance of "support" and the removal of "pressure," so that prices rebound quickly and sharply from declines. 
The common assumption is that this "support" or "pressure" is supplied by "manipulators." But it is quite as likely to result from the scale operations of hundreds of different persons, whose mental make-up prevents them from buying or selling in the "impulsive" way. 

# VIII The Mental Attitude of the Individual 

IN previous chapters we have seen that many, if not most, of the eccentricities古怪的 of speculative markets, commonly charged to manipulation, are in fact due to the peculiar psychological conditions which surround such markets. Especially, and more than all else together, these erratic难以预测的 fluctuations are the result of the efforts of traders to operate, not on the basis of facts, nor on their own judgment as to the effect of facts on prices, but on what they believe will be the probable effect of facts or rumors on the minds of other traders. This mental attitude opens up a broad field of conjecture, which is not limited by any definite boundaries of fact or common sense. 
Yet it would be foolish to assert that assuming a position in the market based on what others will do is a wrong attitude. It is confusing to the uninitiated门外汉, and first efforts to work on such a plan are almost certain to be disastrous ; but for the experienced it becomes a successful, though of course never a certain, method. A child's first efforts to use a sharp tool are likely to result in bloodshed流血事件, but the same tool may trace an exquisite精湛的 carving雕刻 in the hands of an expert. 
What, then, should be the mental attitude of the intelligent buyer and seller of securities? The "long pull" investor, buying outright for cash and holding for a liberal profit, need only consider this matter enough to guard against becoming confused by the vagaries变幻莫测 of public sentiment or by his own inverted reasoning processes. He will get the best results by keeping his eye single to two things : Facts and Prices. The current rate of interest, the earning power of the corporations whose stocks he buys, the development of political conditions as affecting invested capital, and the relation of current prices to the situation as shown by these three factors these constitute the most important food for his mind to work upon. 
When he finds himself wandering off偏离 into a consideration of what "They" will do next, or what effect such and such events may have on the sentiment情绪 of speculators, he cannot do better than to bring himself up with a short turn and sternly bid出价 himself "Back to common sense." 
For the more active trader the situation is different. He need not be entirely unregretful of values or fundamental conditions, but his prime object is to "go with the tide." That means basing his operations to a great extent on what others will think and do. His own mental attitude, then, is a most important part of his equipment for success. 
First, the trader must be a reasoning optimist. A more horrible fate can scarcely be imagined than the shallow pessimism of many market habitudes, whose minds, incapable of grasping the larger forces beneath the movements of prices, take refuge in a cynical disbelief in pretty much everything that makes life worth living. Owing to the nature of the business, however, this optimism must be of a somewhat different character from that which brings success in other lines. As a general thing optimism includes the persistent nourishing of hope, an aggressive confidence, the certainty that you are right, a firm determination to accomplish your end. But you cannot make the stock market move your way by believing that it will do so. Here is one case, at any rate, where New Thought methods cannot be directly applied. 
In the market you are nothing but a chip on the tide of events. Optimism, then, must consist in believing, not that the tide will continually flow your way, but that you will succeed in floating with the tide. Your optimism must be, in a sense, of the intellect, not of the will. An optimism based on determination would, in this case, amount to stubbornness. Another quality that makes for success in nearly every line of business is enthusiasm. For this you have absolutely no use in the stock market. The moment you permit yourself to become enthusiastic, you are subordinating your reasoning powers to your beliefs or desires. 
Enthusiasm helps you influence other men's minds, but in the market you do not desire to do this (unless you happen to be a big bull leader). You wish to keep your mind as clear, cool and unruffled平静的 as the surface of a mountain lake on a calm day. Any emotion enthusiasm, fear, anger, depression will only cloud the intellect. Doubtless it would be axiomatic不证自明的 to warn the trader against stubbornness. It cannot be assumed that any operator would consciously permit himself to become stubborn. The trouble arises in drawing the line between, on the one hand, persistence, consistence统一性, pursuit of a definite plan until conditions change; and, on the other, stubborn adherence to a course of action which subsequent events have proved to be erroneous. 
A day in the country, with the market forgotten, or if necessary forcibly ejected from the thoughts, will often enable the trader to return with a clarified mind, so that he can then intelligently convict or acquit表现 himself of the vice of stubbornness. Sometimes it may become necessary to close all commitments and remain out of the market for a few days. 
One of the most common errors might be described as "getting a notion." This is due to the failure or inability of the trader to take a broad view of the entire situation. Some particular point in the complex conditions which usually control prices, appeals to him strongly and impresses him as certain to have its effect on the market. He acts on this single idea, The idea may be all right, but other counterbalancing factors may prevent it from having its natural effect. 
You encounter these "notions" every day in the Street. You meet a highly conservative individual and ask him what he thinks of the situation. "I am alarmed at the rapid spread of radical sentiment" he replies. "How can we expect capital to branch out into new enterprises when the profits may be swept away at any moment by socialistic legislation?" 
You say mildly that the crops are good, the banking situation sound,business active, etc. But all this produces no impression upon him. He has sold all his stocks and has his money in the banks. (He is also short a considerable line, but he doesn't tell you this). He will not buy again until the public becomes "sane." The next man you talk with says: "We cannot have much decline with the present good crop prospect. Crops lie at the basis of everything. With nine billions of new wealth coming out of the ground and flowing into the channels of trade, we are bound to have prosperous conditions for some time to come." 
You speak of radicalism激进主义, adverse不利的 legislation, high cost of living, etc; but he thinks these are relatively unimportant compared with that $9,000,000,000 of new wealth. Of course, he is long of stocks. 
"To make the worse appear the better reason," said Mr. Socrates, some little time ago. It is too bad we can't have Socrates' comments on Wall Street. The Socratic method applied to the average speculator would produce amusing有趣的 results. Beware of saying, "This is the most important factor in the situation," unless the action of the market shows that others agree with you. Every human mind has its own peculiarities, so presumably yours has, though you can't see them plainly; but the stock market is the meeting of many minds, having every imaginable peculiarity. However important some single factor in the situation may appear to you, it is not going to control the movement of prices regardless of everything else. 
An exaggerated example of "getting a notion" is seen in the so-called "hunch预感，直觉." This term appears to mean, when it means anything, a sort of sudden welling up of instinct so strong as to induce the trader to follow it regardless of reason. In many cases, the "hunch" is nothing more than a strong impulse. Almost any business man will say at times, "I have a feeling that we ought not to do this," or "Somehow I don't like that proposition主张," without being able to explain clearly the grounds for his opposition. Likewise the "hunch" of a man who has watched the stock market for half a lifetime may not be without value. In such a case it doubtless很可能的 represents an accumulation of small indications,each so trifling or so evasive含糊其辞的 that the trader cannot clearly marshal集合 and review them even in his own mind. 
Only the experienced trader is entitled to a "hunch." The novice, or the man who is not closely in touch with technical conditions, is merely making an unusual ass of himself when he talks about a "hunch." The successful trader gradually learns to study his own psychological characteristics and allow to some extent for his customary惯常的 errors of judgment. If he finds that he is generally too hasty in reaching a conclusion, he learns to wait and reflect further. After making his decision, he withdraws it and lays it up on a shelf to ripen. He makes only a part of his full commitment at the moment when he feels most confident, holding the remainder in reserve. 
If he finds that he is usually overcautious, he eventually learns to be a little more daring, to buy a part of his line while his mind is still partially enveloped笼罩 in the mists of doubt. Most of the practical suggestions which can be offered are necessarily of a somewhat negative character. We can point out the errors to be avoided much more successfully than we can lay out a course of positive action. But the following summary may be useful to the active trader: 
(1) Your main purpose must be to keep the mind clear and well balanced. Hence, do not act hastily on apparently sensational information; do not trade so heavily as to become anxious ; and do not permit yourself to be influenced by your position in the market. 
(2) Act on your own judgment, or else act absolutely and entirely on the judgment of another, regardless of your own opinion. "Too many cooks厨子 spoil the broth高汤." 厨子多了烧坏高汤
(3) When in doubt, keep out of the market. Delays cost less than losses. 
(4) Endeavor to catch the trend of sentiment. Even if this should be temporarily against fundamental conditions, it is nevertheless unprofitable to oppose it. 
(5) The greatest fault of ninety-nine out of one hundred active traders is being bullish at high prices and bearish at low prices. Therefore, refuse to follow the market beyond what you consider a reasonable climax巅峰, no matter how large the possible profits that you may appear to be losing by inaction. 
The field covered by these chapters is to a great extent new. As it becomes more thoroughly cultivated, it may be possible to speak with more scientific definiteness. In the meantime, the author hopes that his comments and suggestions may be of some service in helping readers to avoid unwise risks and to apply sound principles of analysis to the investment or speculative situation.

积极的投机股票从不会完全看空。周期中这一私企很少有公众投机，甚至会有一些愿意在获利一点时就卖掉，因此价格不可能有大利润空间。

少部分专业交易者会认为一次下跌是一个机会，因为他们会在上涨时卖掉一部分保证获利，然后等下跌的时候再买进吸收筹码。这一阶段恢复到之前的死寂状态，价格几乎没动。不久，又一个微不足道的上升运动开始，这次带来价格高过第一次价格。少部分精明的交易者放长线，但是大众仍然无动于衷，那些看空的人仍然在有势头的时候抛售股票。渐渐地，股票价格一步步被踩实，突然在某一个事端快速上涨。一些胆小的短头会结束，也许是为了保证一部分获利，或者为了防止自己的投机损失。事实上这才是牛市的开始，这时已经穿透大部分聪明人看好的价格点，另一波的交易者也开始看多了。公众意识到这次上涨开始思考会有一个回调，后面还有很多机会进入。奇怪的是，这些反应除了一点轻微的波动外，不再出现。等待进场的人没有一个满意的机会。价格开始更快速上涨。不时会有短暂的停滞，但是出现太过疲软不值得买，或者突然突然上涨把潜在购买者甩在后头。最终即使是最固执的空头也变得警醒开始大量买入。市场沸腾了，对于那些早进入的现在看空的人来说任何时候都是抛售的好机会。不管他多么坚定地看空，他的神经最终屈服于这种不停的上涨，最终他买进入场，并叹息自己的不会因为没进场而有更多损失。
